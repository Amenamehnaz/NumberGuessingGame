# NumberGuessingGame

# Overview

This is a simple console-based Number Guessing Game built in Java.
The program randomly generates a number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it.
After each guess, the program provides hints such as "Too low" or "Too high" until the correct number is guessed.

This project demonstrates the use of loops, conditionals, random number generation, and user input handling in Java.
